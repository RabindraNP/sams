SAMS Core DEVNOTES

 04/07/05 - version 3.2
 	Added operations in sigoper module. See sigoper dev notes.
	
 03/17/05 - version 3.2
 	- Changes done to use new Envi output format management,
	  in particular, through the new envifile.EnviDataType.


 09/29/04 - version 3.1
 	- SamsDb.getSignature(String path) no longer sorts the signature.
	  Previously we were sorting the signature before returning,
	  but this seems unnecessary as sorting is normally performed 
	  during importation. Moreover, this improves performance a bit.
	  Also a "Sort" operation is now included so the user can perform 
	  this sorting when necessary.
	  
	
 08/23/03 - version 3.0
 	- TO-DO.txt, BUGS.txt added.
	
 08/21/03 - version 3.0
 	- Evaluator: fake_big_value defined to prevent runtime errors during
	  semantic checking.
	- Why beanshell evaluates "abc" == "abc" as false ??
	- Order.compare: possible NPE fixed: orderByExpressions could be null.
	
 08/20/03 - version 3.0
 	- more beanshell (Evaluator) processing
	
 08/18/03 - version 3.0
 	- SamsDb.Order: Starting to use beanshell to evaluate expressions for orders
	  and groupings.
	  PENDING to apply idea for filter conditions...
	  
 	- IOrder defined as an abstraction to order specifications.
	
 08/14/03 - version 3.0
 	- Set the new version 3.0
 	- SamsDb._makeGroupingBy(): string values are put in single quotes.
	  (note: currently, string is the only data type supported.)
	- SamsDb: changes to check for valid attr names, better messages
	  about syntax/semantic errors on conditions. 
	
 08/10/03
 	- Bug fixed: Sometimes allowed for duplicate definitions.
	
 08/10/03
 	- SamsDb: No more Serializable storage. Now, attribute definitions
	  are stored as a properties file.
	  This mechanism also allows a client to store its own properties:
	  New service ISamsDb.getInfoProperties().
	  
	- ISamsDb.IMetadataDef.IAttributeDef.isEditable() eliminated: all
	  defined attributes are editable.
	
 06/21/03 init

	Jonathan,
	
	I will be happy to include this operation as I am just working on the next version of SAMS. 
	
	So, basically the operation will take two inputs:
	  1) A sensor description file (wavelength,band center,FWHM)
	  2) A spectrum S
	and will generate the resampling of S in a file with the format:
		[blank line]
		"Wavelength" [tab] [tab] "Spectrum name" <<-- "spectrum reflectance"??
		wavelength1 [tab] [tab] reflectance1
		wavelength2 [tab] [tab] reflectance2
		Etc...
	
	Can you provide me with the corresponding formulas?
	
	For the sake of generality I think there would be like a "Resampling" operation and maybe SAMS would include some predefined 
	well-known sensor characteristics. What do you think?
	
	In fact, in your case you would:
	  1) Perform the "resampling" operation on a number of signatures;
	  2) then, "export" the generated (resampled) signatures to the ".SIF" format
	
	Let me know.
	
	carlos

	> 1) The spectrum must be resampled to a particular sensor's bands before it
	> can be used.  This requires knowledge of a sensor's band centers and full
	> width at half maximum (ENVI spectral resampling performs this, if you need a
	> reference).  If you want, I could make up a basic format for inputting
	> sensor characteristics (a text file with wavelength,band center,FWHM would
	> be easily readable, I imagine).
	> 2) The spectrum must be saved in a very bizarre ASCII format with the
	> extension ".SIF".  Here is the format:
	> 
	> [blank line]
	> "Wavelength" [tab] "Spectrum name"
	> wavelength1 [tab] reflectance1
	> wavelength2 [tab] reflectance2
	> Etc...
	> 
	> Wavelength must be in either micrometers or nanometers (IMAGINE figures out
	> which it is automatically).  Reflectance must be scaled to either 0 to 1, or
	> 0% to 100%.
	> 
	> Note that there are no spaces between the various fields, just a tab break.
	> The problem that took me the longest was that Imagine really needs that
	> blank line at the top, and if you are using Excel to create this
	> tab-deliminated file, Excel peels off that top line, so you have to add it
	> back with Wordpad or something.
	> 
	> 3) Each spectrum must be saved as a SEPARATE file, not a spectral library
	> like that found in ENVI.
	> 
	> At any rate, I did all this manually, but future uses of ATCOR2/3 could
	> benefit from an easy way to do this, since neither ENVI nor IMAGINE has the
	> required tools.
