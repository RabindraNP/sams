Also check out the Feature Requests entry in
http://casil.ucdavis.edu/tracker/?group_id=32

Some of these features may involve the sams core as well.

- F1, help window, maybe html documentation
- make plot legends optional
- allow to show legends only in legend window
- clipboard operations to work also on groups as units
- import a region or an entire Envi image (?)
		
Design aspects:
- who should define special groups? (like imported/ computed/)
  it should move from samscore to samsgui ...
	
An "easy" language to script signature operations:

script           In Java                    
-------------    -------                    
len = s1.size   len = getSize(s1)             number of points of a signature
s2 = s1 * 0.75  s2 = getScaled(s1, 0.75)      gets a scaled version of a signature
s1 *= 0.75      scale(s1, 0.75)               scales a signature in place
s3 = s1 - s2    s3 = getSubstract(s1, s2)     substraction
d = s1.x        d = getAbscissas(s1)          gets the abscissas of a signature
s4 = s2{x}      s4 = getInterpolated(s2, x)   Interpolation at given abscissas
                                              x: scalar or array
y = s1[0]       y = valueAtIndex(s1, 0)       subindexing
