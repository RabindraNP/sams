SAMS GUI TO-DO
Carlos A. Rueda.
$Id$

(Some may involve the core, of course.)

- F1, help window, maybe html documentation
- make plot legends optional
- allow to show legends only in legend window
- clipboard operations to work also on groups as units
- import a region or an entire Envi image (?)
		
Design aspects:
- who should define special groups? (like imported/ computed/)
  it should move from samscore to samsgui ...
