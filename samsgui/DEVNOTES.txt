 Pending features:
 	- who should define special groups? (like imported/ computed/)
	  it should move from  samscore to samsgui ...
	  Check "import from ascii" (files go under root /)
 	- make plot legends optional
	- allow to show legends only in legend window
	- add virtual groupings
	- import from envi
	- new grouping by attr value
	- new grouping by filename (?)
	- About
	- Splash, initialization progress
	- improve renaming from dialog (from tree). See DbGui.rename().
		
 Pending bugs:
	- rename of a root child makes disappear the element in tree display
	- CorrectionOperation: check operation when forward=false, additive=false
	  (it's giving out a "reflection"--check sign in correction variable)
		
 08/01/03
	- synchronized group/spectra elements managenent: tree operations consider now
	  when spectra or group elements are being processed. In particular, it is
	  possible to have a group and a spectrum (siblings) having the same (visible)
	  name (on disk they are 'xxx' for the group and 'xxx.sig' for the signature).
	
 07/31/03
 	- create subgroup ready
 	- delete group included in clipboard management
 	- create/update metadata ready
	- import from ascii
	
 07/29/03
 	- New scheme for SamsDb implementation:
		- name.sig:    stores the signature
		- name.sig.md: stores the metadata (PENDING to create/update)
		- Spectrum not longer stored (serializable)
		- "location", "name" are not longer explicit stored attributes
	- Implicit "location", "name" attributes shown in Table.
	- Rename as a command from tree display.

 	- rename already working from table.
 	- view-data ready: now uses a JTable and the user can modify/save the contents
	  including the user object (info) if any. See DbGui.viewData().  
	  (Old command view-source was eliminated).
	- Export (Envi, Envi-spectral-library, Ascii) ready. 
	- clipboard interaction improvement: right-click now updates 
	  selection. See DbGui.click()
