 03/17/05 - version 3.2
 	- Exporter now allows the user to specify the data type
	  for Envi output formats (std image and spectral library).
	  Changes were done in the envifile and samscore module to
	  support this (in particular, through the new class 
	  envifile.EnviDataType).
	  
	- Import signatures from ascii file: Now a pattern for
	  the suffix of new names can be specified. This uses
	  a java.text.Decimal.Format.
 	


 09/29/04 - version 3.1
 	- New operations included in base_dist/opers/:
		sort.s.bsh
		resample.b.bsh
		
 04/06/04 - version 3.1
 	- Just change in version with new izpack installer activated
	  and splash image rotated to better fit in installation window.
	
 09/19/03 - version 3.0
 	- izshortcut.xml fixed: the one for unix was deleted.
	
 09/11/03 - version 3.0
 	- izpack installer specification updated to work on unix
	  targets.
	  
 08/29/03 - version 3.0
 	- New Info.getSAMSDirectory() (based on "sams.dir" system property).
	- Initialization with getSAMSDirectory()/opers/ (now with only two
	  simple examples).
 	- izpack now used to build installer, which allows for
	  shortcuts (among many other things).
	
 08/23/03 - version 3.0
 	- TO-DO.txt, BUGS.txt added.
	
 08/21/03 - version 3.0
 	- comboboxes for table control panel.
	
 08/18/03 - version 3.0
 	- Tree.updateReadOnlyGroupingBy(String[]) eliminated.
 	- Table changed to use IOrder
 	- "refresh-grouping" now updates all groupings.
	
 08/17/03 - version 3.0
 	- Installer ready.
	
 08/14/03 - version 3.0
 	- Set the new version 3.0
	- minor changes in messages
	- SamsGui.message's in Table.ControlPanel
	
 08/13/03
 	- Plot no longer extends ptolemy.plot.Plot but delegates on it.
	  This will ease a different implementation in a future version.
 	- refresh-grouping action implemented
	- No more grouping creation/update as a byproduct of sorting table:
	  it's enough to have the option "new-grouping-by-attribute".
 	- Code factoring in import options (Importer).
	- Import from envi implemented.
	- Cosmetic improvements in splash, import messages.
	
 08/11/03
	- Action: "import-files-database" renamed to "import-directory"
	- Action: "import-files" created: to import specific files.
	- Import options now allow the user to specify a target location group.
	
 	- improved About window (with tabs).
 	- new grouping by attribute also enabled from a Database menu option.
	- Import from system clipboard eliminated (never reimplemented).
	
 08/10/03
 	- Grouping definitions are now stored (using the properties associated
	  to each database). These definition are:
	  	- created when new grouping given from table
		- removed when click-delete over grouping and attribute removal in
		  metadata definition edition.
 	- Table.TableModel.isCellEditable: only "location" is not editable.
 	- Controller.delete() now allows to delete virtual groupings.
	  This is done inmmediately without confirmation.
 	- Tree.getSelectedSpectraPaths() won't be deleted. It now assures the
	  returned list doesn't have duplicate location paths.
	- Splash, initialization progress.
	- Info properties management.
	
 08/09/03
 	- Tree.getSelectedGroupPaths() deleted.
	
 08/05/03
 	- Grouping-by included in tree display:
	     location: is the structure reflecting the real paths to signatures
		 status:
		 species:
		 status:location:
		 etc:      are read-only groupings generated by Tree.updateReadOnlyGroupingBy(attrNames)
		           based on db.getGroupingBy(attrNames)
	  Tree.updateReadOnlyGroupingBy is called by DbGui when table.sort is called, which
	  happens when a text is entered in the "Sort field" input field. 
 	- cut/delete clipboard operation now check if selection is only under "location:" grouping
	  (since other groupings are read-only).
	- Compute: now asks for destination group for new signatures.
	- About command implemented.
	
 08/01/03
	- synchronized group/spectra elements managenent: tree operations consider now
	  when spectra or group elements are being processed. In particular, it is
	  possible to have a group and a spectrum (siblings) having the same (visible)
	  name (on disk they are 'xxx' for the group and 'xxx.sig' for the signature).
	
 07/31/03
 	- create subgroup ready
 	- delete group included in clipboard management
 	- create/update metadata ready
	- import from ascii
	
 07/29/03
 	- New scheme for SamsDb implementation:
		- name.sig:    stores the signature
		- name.sig.md: stores the metadata (PENDING to create/update)
		- Spectrum not longer stored (serializable)
		- "location", "name" are not longer explicit stored attributes
	- Implicit "location", "name" attributes shown in Table.
	- Rename as a command from tree display.

 07/28/03
 	- rename already working from table.
 	- view-data ready: now uses a JTable and the user can modify/save the contents
	  including the user object (info) if any. See DbGui.viewData().  
	  (Old command view-source was eliminated).
	- Export (Envi, Envi-spectral-library, Ascii) ready. 
	- clipboard interaction improvement: right-click now updates 
	  selection. See DbGui.click()
	  
 07/25/03
	- clipboard operations: 
		- Tree: new MyNode to simplify node management.
		- new element in status bar for clipboard contents.
		
 07/24/03
	- clipboard operations: 
		- progress-bar now working very nicely.
		- all copy-cut-paste-delete operations already implemented
		- table updated.
		
 07/23/03
	- Now on copy-cut-paste-delete actions ...
	- Compute: All "string" parameters are required.
	- Table updated after a computation.
	- No repeated nodes in tree.
	
 07/22/03
	- Compute: checking required paramters...
	
 07/21/03
	- Now on single- and binary- operations ...
	  See Compute.SingleForm.go()
	
 07/10/03
	- Import from directory
	- Import from Ascii file

 07/09/03
	- Preferences for:
		- last directory used for import
		- path to last open database

 07/07/03
	- EditMetadataDefinition
