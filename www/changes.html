      SAMS - Changes

      Changes in 3.0
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Internally, SAMS now uses a different, more flexible
        scheme to store databases. Among other things, the 
		user now specifies the directory where a SAMS
        database is located.
      </li>
      <li>
        More than one database can be open simultaneously,
		each on its own window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Elements in the spectra table can now be sorted and
        filtered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grouping creation has been reimplemented to allow for
        more general criteria. A grouping is specified as a list
        of expressions. Expressions may have different forms, the
        name of an attribute being one very common. Groups are
		created according to different values of given expressions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better progress report in long operations: dialog boxes
		show what is being done, involved signatures, and error messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        "paste" is now a real copy of signatures. ("paste
        reference" is no longer available.)
      </li>
    </ul>
