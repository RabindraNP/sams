# SAMS - Spectral Analysis and Management System

The Spectral Analysis and Management System (SAMS) is a Java application to manage field spectra databases and analyses.
Features include: import/export options in various formats, signature groupings, metadata management, common operations
on single or multiple signatures, richer set of plotting capabilities, and a simple data structure for easy integration
with other applications.

SAMS was originally developed at [CSTARS](http://cstars.metro.ucdavis.edu/),
the Center for Spatial Technologies and Remote Sensing (UC Davis),
and hosted at https://projects.atlas.ca.gov/projects/sams/.
In late 2011 the project was moved to Google Code and from there to Github in 2015.

**Please note**: except for very occasional updates mainly triggered by inquiries from users, the fact is that
there hasn't been any active development of the project for quite a while.
As an open source project, however, anyone interested is welcome to help keep some form of activity,
that is, by reporting issues, contributing updates via pull requests, etc.

## Running SAMS

### Requirement

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.4 or newer, is required to execute SAMS.
You can download a JRE from https://www.java.com/ for your OS.

### Download SAMS executable

Create a directory for SAMS application purposes and download SAMS JAR file into that directory.

Then, open a terminal or Cmd session, and, with `<SAMS_DIRECTORY>` indicating the said directory,
execute:

```
cd <SAMS_DIRECTORY>
java -jar sams-3.2.1.jar
```
